#### Syllabus

This  course discusses  the  practical  issues  and techniques  for  data  importing,  tidying, transforming,  and  modeling. The  course  will  offer  a  gentle introduction to  techniques  for processing big data. Programming is  a cross-cutting aspect of the course.  Students  will  gain experience  with  data  science  tools  through short  assignments.  The  course  work includes a term project based on real-world data.  Required topics include: Data management and processing: definition & background; Data transformation; Data import; Data cleaning; Data modeling; Relational and analytic databases; Basics of SQL; Programming in R and/or Python; MapReduce fundamentals and distributed data management; Data processing pipelines, connecting multiple data management and analysis components; Interaction between the capabilities and requirements of  data analysis methods (data structures, algorithms, memory requirements) and the choice of data storage and management tools; Repeatable and reproducible data analysis.

#### Overview

Data Science is a discipline that combines computing with statistics. A data analysis problem is solved in a series of data-centric steps: data acquistion and representation (Import), data cleaning (Tidy), and an iterative sequence of data transformation (Transform), data modelling (Model) and data visualization (Vsiualize).  The end result of the process is to communicate insights obtained from the data (Communicate). This class will take you through all the steps in the process and will teach you how to approach such problems in a systematic manner. You will learn how to _design data analysis pipelines_ as well as how to implement them in a widely used language. The class will emphasize how elegant code leads to reproducible science.

Along the way you will pick up a number of skills.  You will become proefficient in the R programming language and concepts such as as data frames, vectorized computation and lazy functional and object-oriented programming; you will learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and be exposed to big data problems.

The class The class will use several small project and will lead to a group project in which you will deliver a solution to a real-world data analysis challenge.

#### Exercises

The class will feature 10 exercise sets. Exo sets are due, electronically, before class. Students are required to complete them as they reinforce the material discussed in class.  Four randomly selected exo sets will be graded, the best three scores will be retained for the final grade. 

#### InClass Participation

Each student will get at least 5 in-class participation grades. These grades are based on answers to questions about assigned reading, codewalks, and presentations. Students are selected randomly for in-class participation. The four best grades are retained.

#### Grading

The grade in this class will be based on (a) final project presentation (30%), (b) final project report (30%), exercise sets (20%), in class participation (20%).
