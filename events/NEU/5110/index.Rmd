#### Syllabus

This  course discusses  the  practical  issues  and techniques  for  data  importing,  tidying, transforming,  and  modeling. The  course  will  offer  a  gentle introduction to  techniques  for processing big data. Programming is  a cross-cutting aspect of the course.  Students  will  gain experience  with  data  science  tools  through short  assignments.  The  course  work includes a term project based on real-world data.  Required topics include: Data management and processing: definition & background; Data transformation; Data import; Data cleaning; Data modeling; Relational and analytic databases; Basics of SQL; Programming in R and/or Python; MapReduce fundamentals and distributed data management; Data processing pipelines, connecting multiple data management and analysis components; Interaction between the capabilities and requirements of  data analysis methods (data structures, algorithms, memory requirements) and the choice of data storage and management tools; Repeatable and reproducible data analysis.

#### Overview

Data Science is a discipline that combines computing with statistics. A data analysis problem is solved in a series of data-centric steps: data acquistion, data representation, data cleaning, data modelling and data visualization.  This class will teach you how to approach such problems in a systematic manner. We will emphasize that elegant code leads to reproducible science.

Along the way you will pick up a number of skills.  You will become proefficient in the R programming language, you will learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and be exposed to big data problems.

The class will use several small project and will lead to a group project in which you will deliver a solution to a real-world data analysis challenge.
