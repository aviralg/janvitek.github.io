For what benefit?Today, it is really hard to say what is the actual, measurable benefit of OA for the research community. Everybody else seems to benefit from it but the researchers: commercial publishers have a new source of income, predatory publishers live off it, industry gets free access to research results. By contrast, if my department had to pay author fees for all the papers published by its faculty, it would triple or quadruple the cost of the current subscriptions to my institution (even if we assume it would replace these subscription, which obviously is not the case today).So I think OA is a good idea IN PRINCIPLE, but we haven't found the proper way to implement it yet. I think a reasonable solution would is the following:1) Green OA by institutional repositories for recent publications;2) OA to all publications that are older than a few years (3-5 years?) by the traditional publishers (including ACM).This way, you get the funding for Green OA from research institutions for recent works and you ensure OA in perpetuity after that from the traditional publishers.
